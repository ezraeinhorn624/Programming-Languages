I used the following test: tower(4,_,counts([3,2,4,1],[3,3,1,2],[2,4,1,2],[1,1,1,4]))
Ratio: 8.354

Running ambiguous(5,C,T1,T2) gave me the following puzzles: 

C = counts([4,2,3,2,1],[1,3,2,3,2],[5,3,2,3,1],[1,2,3,2,2])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,1,4,5,3],[4,5,2,3,1],[3,4,5,1,2],[5,3,1,2,4]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4,5],[3,1,4,5,2],[4,5,2,3,1],[2,4,5,1,3],[5,3,1,2,4]] 

C = counts([4,2,3,2,1],[2,2,1,4,3],[5,3,2,1,3],[1,2,3,2,2])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,1,4,5,3],[4,5,2,3,1],[5,3,1,2,4],[3,4,5,1,2]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4,5],[3,1,4,5,2],[4,5,2,3,1],[5,3,1,2,4],[2,4,5,1,3]]
